    <p class="h2">The world saw the highest number of recorded executions in more than 25 years in 2015, according to a new report from human rights group Amnesty International.
    In what the organization called an "alarming surge," at least 1,634 people were executed last year, an increase of more than 50% on 2014.
    "The rise in executions last year is profoundly disturbing," said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's Secretary General, in a statement.
    According to the rights group's annual report the dramatic increase was fueled by three nations -- Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia -- who together were responsible for nearly 90% of executions in 2015.
